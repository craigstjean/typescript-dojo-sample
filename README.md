## Comments

This is just a sample to show how to setup a project using Dojo and TypeScript.  Common things, such as header
view models, footers, complex routing, etc. are not included.  If you would like to see more detail in certain areas
please file an issue and I'll see what I can do.

Note, \_all.ts is generated via Makefile
